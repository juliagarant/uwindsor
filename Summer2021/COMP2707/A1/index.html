    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p id="pg1" class="index">My name is Julia Garant. I have a bit of web development experience from courses like COMP2057. I completed a coop experience in summer 2020 where I was introduced to UX/UI which allowed me to design app features for Audacia BioScience. I'm starting my fourth year in Honours Computer Science with a specialization in multimedia. I have also completed a math minor.</p>

    <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    <p id="pg2" class="index">In taking this course I intend to develop my web development skills. I would like to have a better understanding of css and JavaScript and how they work with a page. I really enjoy multimedia and its aspects so understanding how to make websites attractive is one of my goals. I also want to know more html tags so I can use them in other projects down the line.</p>

      <p id="pg3" class="index">This is a personal website of a friend of mine. I think his website is an example of good design. There is a captivating background and four clickable icons directing the user based on each image. He has linked his GitHub account for potential employers to view his coding experience. He also includes his resume and an instant email link for anyone interested. Lastly he includes his LinkedIn showing another version of his professional profile.
