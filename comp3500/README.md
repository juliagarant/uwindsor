# COMP3500 - Introduction to Multimedia Systems
Final project for COMP3500

It's messy, and its all in main. I didn't make a folder for images or outputs because my professor is going to be accessing it through command line I assume.
It applies a filter to the chosen image and creates a new image for the output.

This code allows the user to choose an image of any file type and split it up horizontally or vertically. They also have the ability to choose the pixel amount of each slice. 

I hated this since it was our final project but the first time we actually coded for the class too. And we had to use a specific library that I had no experience in.
