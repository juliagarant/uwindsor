# COMP3500 - Introduction to Multimedia Systems
Final project for COMP3500

It's messy, and its all in main. I didn't make a folder for images or outputs because my professor is going to be accessing it through command line I assume.
It applies a filter to the chosen image and creates a new image for the output.

I hated this since it was our final project but the first time we actually coded for the class too. And we had to use a specific library that I had no experience in.
