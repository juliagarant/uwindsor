    <p>This is the first HTML coding project for Introduction to the Internet. I don't exactly know what to discuss in this paragraph so I will give a little bit about myself. I am <b>Croatian</b>, I really like books, and I like taking pictures of my friends. I'm in my second year of Computer Science and I'm really enjoying it so far.<br>Here is a quote from Hagrid in <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>:</p> <blockquote cite="https://mashable.com/article/best-harry-potter-quotes/">I am what I am, an' I'm not ashamed. 'Never be ashamed,' my ol' dad used ter say, 'there's some who'll hold it against you, but they're not worth botherin' with.

    <p style="border:2px solid chartreuse; color:indigo">I really wanted to use this colour in this webpage.I've had a lot of fun playing with the style attribute for this project. I like all of the different colour names like <q cite="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">Chartreuse, and Indigo</q>.<br>I'm excited to see how <b>CSS</b> can make a webpage more interactive and am even more excited to potentially use <b>javascript</b>.<br>This is the video file required for this project.  </p>
